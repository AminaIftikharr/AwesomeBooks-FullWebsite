# AwesomeBooks-FullWebsite

**Overview:**
The "AwesomeBooks" project is a simple web application that allows users to input and display information about books, including the title and author. Users can add books to a list, view the list of added books, and remove books from the list.

**Files:**
1. index.html: The main HTML file that structures the web page. It includes input fields for the title and author, an "Add" button to add books, and a section to display the list of added books.
2. style.css: The CSS file that styles the appearance of the web page. It provides a professional and aesthetically pleasing look, including styles for the header, form container, input fields, buttons, and book list.
3. index.js: The JavaScript file that contains the logic for adding books. It retrieves input values, creates new book entries, and appends them to the list.

**Usage**
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser to access the AwesomeBooks application.
2. Enter the title and author of a book in the input fields.
3. Click the "Add" button to add the book to the list.
4. View the list of added books below the input section.
5. To remove a book, click the "Remove" button next to the book entry.
